Employee's NI Number
Employee's Full Name

Note: Please don't use anybody's real information - dummy information is perfectly fine

The above information should be stored in an Array as JSON data. (There is no need for any DBMS - Database Management System)

You must meet the following requirements:

The project must be written in PURE JavaScript
All the employee information should be displayed on the screen
Users must be able to add an employee to the list
Users must be able to edit employee information
Users must be able to delete an employee
Users must be able to filter the list of employees based on their department through a dropdown box / search bar - i.e. HR, Sales etc.
You must create separate files for your HTML, JS, CSS etc.
Be as creative as you'd like with the design of the application.

Stretch Goals

Why are we doing this?
To learn to understand the basics of javascript

it had a few hiccups, mainly when i went beyond the strech goals. 

What went well?
The pulling of the information and the edit function. 

What didn't go as planned?
my beyond stretch goals 

Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
a uniformed design, including all images and css so it flicked a switch. id like to be able to add a json server.
